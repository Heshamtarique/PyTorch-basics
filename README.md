# PyTorch Basics
In this series, we have divided our experiment in two parts-- we used deep learning techniques to train our model and let it do binary classification. In the first experiment we classify cancer being Malignant or Beningn with test size of 20%. learning rate of 0.001, and the optimizer being Stochastic Gradiant Decent. We get an accuracy of 83.335 in 100 epochs. 
-----

In second experiment we changed the optimizer to ADAM, learning rate to 0.01. We get an accuracy of 97.8% in 500 epochs.
